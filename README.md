# A Remnote to Obsidian Note Conversion tool

This python script reads in a txt file in the same repository that has been copied and pasted from remnote that the user wishes to convert to Obsidian while maintaining their highlighter colours.

Using [Linkslayer's](https://github.com/Derv-OFlynn/LinkSlayer) link removal as a basis, it does not remove links but instead replaces the highlighting from remnote with the inline css highlighting from obsidian with the user's desired colours.

All highlighted text and differently coloured text in Remnote is read by Obsidian as using the markdown highlighted format: ```==example==```

The Obsidian-generated "==" are replaced by the inline CSS generated by the [Highlightr Plugin](https://github.com/chetachiezikeuzor/Highlightr-Plugin) made by [Chetachi Ezikeuzor](https://github.com/chetachiezikeuzor) and modifying the pre-made colours to be optimised for darkmode accessibility.

## Notes:
Remnote Heading Sizes do not carry over to Obsidian.
